# Outfit-Builder-Contest

Want to create your own outfit and enter it into a contest for cash? 
If so, design your own outfit and submit it. Then, vote on the best outfit!   

This application was first implemented at HackAppleton 2018 (April, 2018) with a team of 4. We used Python and HTML. For the next month, I implemented a GUI using the TKinter library in Python. The code is not very clean or optimized, but this was one of my first programs. It was also during my senior year of high school. This event and program sparked my passion for coding.
